Please fill out the following and submit with your Final Project submission 
(added to help us know what to focus on when grading, what was intentionally 
incomplete, etc.):

1. What is your estimated grade for the Final Project (roughly of 100)? 
   For partner projects, do you think the workload distribution was fair?
   
   I think that I should get somewhere around a 95%. Everything on my website
   works, but I may not have done the APIDOC and error handling
   properly, thus losing points.

2. What is your estimated grade for the course (letter grade)? You can support your
   estimate with examples of demonstrated engagement in the course material, strengths
   (and weaknesses) over the term, and growth throughout the material (some assignment
   grading feedback was delayed, but we would like to know what resources you used to
   iterate on the material, such as lectures, OH, Discord, etc.)

    I think that I will get an A. I've done really well on all my homeworks
    and cps as noted by Professor Hovik. I have good documentation, label
    variables adequately, and always complete the projects.

3. To what extent would you like feedback in your project (e.g. thorough, 
   particular areas of the project, or just a grade)?

Just a grade

4. Anything else you would like El to know when grading?
 I worked alone so even though the UI is not perfect, I put a lot of time into 
 everything else.

5. Are you open to sharing your project/reflection for future terms? If so, would you
   like named credit or anonymous?

   Would prefer that my project does not get used in the future.
